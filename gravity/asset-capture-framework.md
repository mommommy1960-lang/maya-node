# Asset Capture Framework

## Overview

The Asset Capture Framework defines the mechanisms and protocols for attracting, capturing, and retaining digital assets within the ecosystem.

## Core Concepts

### Gravitational Pull
Assets experience gravitational forces based on various factors:
- Market capitalization
- Liquidity depth
- Network effects
- Strategic positioning

### Capture Mechanics
The framework implements multiple capture strategies:
1. **Passive Capture**: Natural attraction through ecosystem benefits
2. **Active Capture**: Targeted incentive programs
3. **Retention Mechanisms**: Strategies to prevent asset flight

## Architecture

### Components
- Gravity Field Generator
- Asset Tracker
- Magnetism Calibrator
- Retention Monitor

### Data Flow
```
Asset Detection → Gravity Calculation → Capture Attempt → Retention Management
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Phase 1: Detection
- Identify high-value assets
- Analyze movement patterns
- Assess capture potential

### Phase 2: Attraction
- Deploy gravitational mechanisms
- Optimize magnetism parameters
- Monitor effectiveness

### Phase 3: Retention
- Implement holding strategies
- Prevent competitive capture
- Maximize long-term value

## Metrics and KPIs

- Capture rate
- Retention duration
- Asset value growth
- Network stability index

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning optimization
- Dynamic gravity field adjustment
- Cross-chain capture protocols
