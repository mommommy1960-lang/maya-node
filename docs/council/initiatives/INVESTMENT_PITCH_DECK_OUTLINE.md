## SLIDE 2: The Problem

**Headline:** AI Is Powerful, But Who's In Control?

**Visual:** Split-screen showing:
- Left: Surveillance, manipulation, bias, privacy violations
- Right: Users powerless, "black box" AI, no accountability

**Key Points:**
- **AI is everywhere:** ChatGPT, recommendation systems, hiring tools, healthcare, finance
- **But AI is opaque:** Users don't know what's happening inside
- **Users have no control:** Data harvested, decisions made without consent
- **Ethics are afterthoughts:** Most AI companies prioritize scale over safety
- **Consequences are real:** Bias, discrimination, privacy violations, manipulation

**Statistics to Include:**
- 85% of consumers concerned about AI privacy (source: [research])
- $1.2B in AI ethics violations fines (EU, 2023-2024)
- 72% of enterprises cite governance as top AI challenge
- Only 15% of AI projects have comprehensive ethics frameworks

**Talking Points:**
- AI has incredible potential, but current trajectory is concerning
- Centralized control, lack of transparency, no user sovereignty
- This isn't sustainable—regulation is coming, customers are demanding better
- Market opportunity for "ethical by design" AI infrastructure

## PRESENTATION NOTES

### Deck Flow Tips:

1. **Start Strong:** Hook investors in first 3 minutes with problem and vision
2. **Tell a Story:** Connect slides into narrative arc, not disconnected facts
3. **Be Concise:** Aim for 15-20 minute presentation + 10-15 min Q&A
4. **Show Confidence:** You know this space better than investors do
5. **Be Authentic:** Let mission and passion show through—that's your advantage

### Anticipate Questions:

**"Why will developers choose Maya Node over AWS/Google?"**
- We complement them, not compete. We're the ethics layer on top of their infrastructure. Plus, we're open source—no vendor lock-in.

**"How do you defend against big tech cloning your product?"**
- CERL-1.0 is our moat—they can't replicate ethical governance without commitment. Our community and trust are hard to replicate. First-mover advantage in category.

**"What if regulation doesn't happen?"**
- Customer demand for ethics is already here. Regulation accelerates adoption, but not required. Enterprises need governance regardless.

**"How do you scale without compromising mission?"**
- Commons governance structure, CERL-1.0 in all contracts, board includes ethics advisors, transparent decision-making.

**"What's your customer acquisition cost and payback period?"**
- CAC ~$2K, payback period ~8 months on Professional tier, LTV ~$10K. Strong unit economics.

**"Why not bootstrap entirely?"**
- Could bootstrap, but investment accelerates growth 2x. Market timing matters—first-mover advantage. Investment gives us breathing room to focus on product and customers vs. constant fundraising.
