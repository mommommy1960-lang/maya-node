## Welcome to the Commons

The Commons Initiative is building a new model for technology development—one that puts ethics, transparency, and human sovereignty at the center. Through the Maya Node ecosystem, we're creating tools and infrastructure that empower individuals and organizations to use AI responsibly, maintain control over their data, and participate in a more equitable digital future.

This document outlines our key initiatives for 2025 and how you can get involved.

## Our Mission

**To build ethical AI infrastructure that serves humanity, not exploits it.**

We believe that:
- Technology should be transparent and auditable
- Users should have sovereignty over their data and AI interactions
- AI systems must operate under clear ethical constraints
- Innovation and responsibility are not mutually exclusive
- Open governance leads to better outcomes for everyone

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Ethics First
Every component of Maya Node operates under the **CERL-1.0 (Commons Ethical Research License)**, which explicitly prohibits:
- Weaponization or harm
- Surveillance or privacy violations
- Manipulation or deception
- Discrimination or bias
- Environmental destruction

All AI operations are subject to ethics verification before and after execution, with a complete audit trail.

### 2. Sovereignty & Consent
Users maintain control through:
- **Consent tokens** for every AI operation
- **Transparent decision-making** with explainable AI
- **Human oversight** capability at all levels
- **Data ownership** that never transfers away from users
- **Right to revoke** consent at any time

### 3. Transparency & Auditability
Maya Node provides:
- **Immutable audit ledger** for all operations
- **Open source code** for community review
- **Public governance** through Commons Council
- **No black-box AI** - only vetted, explainable models
- **Regular ethics reports** and impact assessments

### 4. Accessibility & Inclusion
We are committed to:
- Making technology accessible to all abilities
- Supporting underserved communities
- Pricing that reflects mission over profit
- Open education and training programs
- Diverse representation in governance and development

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is Maya Node really open source?**  
A: Yes! All core code is available on GitHub under CERL-1.0. Anyone can inspect, modify, and use it, subject to ethical constraints.

**Q: How do you make money if it's open source?**  
A: We offer hosted services, enterprise features, training, and support. Open source is about freedom, not price.

**Q: What if someone uses Maya Node for harmful purposes?**  
A: The CERL-1.0 license explicitly prohibits harmful uses. We monitor for violations and can revoke licenses. The ethics engine also blocks prohibited operations.

**Q: How is this different from other "ethical AI" initiatives?**  
A: We're not just talking about ethics—we've built it into the code with enforceable constraints, audit trails, and consent requirements. It's ethical by design, not by policy.

**Q: Can I use Maya Node for commercial purposes?**  
A: Yes! As long as your use complies with CERL-1.0 (no surveillance, weaponization, harm, etc.), commercial use is encouraged.

**Q: How do I know my data is safe?**  
A: Maya Node is sovereignty-first: your data never leaves your control. We can't access it, sell it, or use it. Audit trails prove this.

**Q: Is Maya Node only for large organizations?**  
A: No! We have free and low-cost tiers for individuals and small teams. Pricing scales with use and capability.

**Q: How can I influence the roadmap?**  
A: Participate in governance forums, vote on proposals if you're a contributor, join community calls, or join the advisory board.

## Thank You

The Commons is built by people like you—developers, advocates, users, funders, and dreamers who believe technology can and should serve humanity's highest aspirations.

Every line of code, every contribution, every conversation moves us closer to a future where AI empowers rather than exploits, where technology enhances human dignity rather than diminishes it, and where innovation and ethics go hand in hand.

**Join us. Build the Commons. Shape the future.**
