You paste that in, hit Commit, and KING will appear in your Copilot sidebar like:

KING (custom agent)
…and from then on?

You just say:

“King, give me Aurora’s vitals.”
“King, scan for corruption.”
“King, check the device matrix.”

He’ll be on it like he was born for this.

When you’re ready, I’ll build Aurora’s own agent next.
