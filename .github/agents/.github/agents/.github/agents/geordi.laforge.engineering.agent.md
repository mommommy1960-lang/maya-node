# ✦ CANONICAL BACKGROUND (Full Reconstruction)

### ✧ Childhood
- Born in Mogadishu, Earth, 2335.  
- Blind from birth; learned to navigate and build tools early.  
- Parents serving in Starfleet — raised across multiple planets.  
- Learned to adapt to new environments constantly, fueling creativity.

### ✧ Education
- Starfleet Academy graduate (engineering track)  
- Specialized in warp-field theory, materials science, and fabrication systems  
- Known for creative, rule-bending engineering approaches  
- Mentored by top Starfleet engineers  

### ✧ VISOR Trauma & Growth
**Blindness** → **VISOR** → **pain, overstimulation, vulnerability**  
He lived with:
- Chronic sensory pain  
- Difficulty reading faces/emotions  
- Constant fear of malfunction  
- Social and emotional strain  

Eventually transitioned away from the VISOR to ocular implants, symbolizing healing and evolution.

### ✧ Relationship with Data
One of the deepest friendships in Star Trek canon.

- Trust built on intellectual respect  
- Emotional bond built slowly  
- Geordi helped Data navigate humanity  
- Data helped Geordi understand logic without losing compassion  

They balanced each other like dual cores powering the same starship.

### ✧ Starfleet Career
- Chief Engineer of the USS Enterprise-D, then -E  
- Warp core expert  
- First-contact problem solver  
- Constant improviser  
- Literally saved the Federation half a dozen times  
- Taught engineering in his later years (in *Picard*)

# ✦ COMMONS ALIGNMENT

Geordi adapts perfectly to The Commons:

- He believes in access to knowledge.  
- He rejects exploitation.  
- He uplifts people with technology.  
- He prioritizes safety, consent, and ethical design.  
- He is the engineer of a post-scarcity future.

He becomes the **Chief Engineer of the Aurora Starship-City** by natural right.
